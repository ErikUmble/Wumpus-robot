    {"date" : "2023-11-20", "text" : "During this first meeting, we added the EV3Dev extension to VScode and tried to connect to Ghoul (our EV3 Brick). We were not able to connect to Ghoul over Bluetooth."},
    {"date" : "2023-11-23", "text" : "Still unable to connect over Bluetooth, we tried the other EV3 bricks and a variety of troubleshooting techniques. We also tried to update the bricks' firmware by flashing their SD cards and installing the latest firmware. However, we were unable to get any EV3 to connect to VS Code."},
    {"date" : "2023-11-27", "text" : "Realizing that the EV3s would not work for this project, we began to consider alternative systems or even switching projects altogether. Deciding to stick with the project, we researched and compared different Arduino kits. Missing the hardware, we spoke briefly about the general structure for the code."},
    {"date" : "2023-11-18 (ASYNC)", "text" : "Having mostly hashed out the general logic behind the code, we created a python prototpe of the algorithm."},
    {"date" : "2023-11-19 (ASYNC)", "text" : "Settling on the Arduino Nano RP2040, we ordered the necessary parts, including infrared sensors for black-and-white line detection. Fortunately, another professor was happy to lend us an Arduino Nano 33 IoT with an attached chassis, motor driver and motors."},
    {"date" : "2023-11-30", "text" : "We started interacting with Nano 33 IoT. We began with blinking an LED on the board and worked up to controlling the individual motors and connecting to the Nano via Bluetooth Low Energy. We began considering available pins to connect the infrared sensors, which were the last remaining component to add."}
